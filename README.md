# üí° How it Works

## Search function

When you make a request for a search, SteamPeek sends your query to its backend services. The backend services does some magic and makes sure that the response is as accurate as possible. Under proper usage, you are guaranteed get the Steam information about the game but existence of other information (ProtonDB, IGDB) will depend on if those sites carry it.

I can't reveal too much more, sorry!

# SmartSearch

When you open SteamPeek on a supported page, it parses the HTML of that page in order to extract the name of the game that is being shown. SteamPeek will then automatically begin a search for that game for you.

# üìùNotes and Disclaimers
1. Steampeek is intended for use with games currently available on the Steam game marketplace. You may try other games but your mileage will vary.
2. If you experience slowdowns, please try waiting or closing and re-opening the extension. This is caused by the backend being slow due to budgetary issues.
3. SteamPeek is independently owned and operated and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Valve Corporation, Steam, ProtonDB, IGDB, any individual games, their publishers, their developers, or any other platforms mentioned.
